      <description>American Charitable Trust is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping American citizens in need. The primary purpose of ACT is to identify those in need through local organizations and individual nominations, and to provide care for those United States citizens who are in need of assistance.
We believe in Americans helping Americans. American Charitable Trust was created in order to collect donations from the generous benefactors who support our cause and distribute these funds to American citizens in need.</description>
