      <description>At Students for Life, we transform culture by recruiting, training, and mobilizing pro-lifers to abolish abortion. We launch and support Students for Life groups in colleges, high schools, middle schools, law schools, and med schools throughout the nation to educate other young people about the violence of abortion, create new pro-lifers, and transform campuses into places that support pregnant and parenting students.</description>
