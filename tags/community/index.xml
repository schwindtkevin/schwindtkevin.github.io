      <description>Exodus 90 is all about freedom. Why? Because without freedom, we cannot love as we ought. It’s about our wives, children, parishes and friends who suffer when we’re not at our best. The goal is to achieve the freedom necessary to fully engage the love of God and the love of neighbor. Exodus 90 is based on a challenging 90-day period of purification, a dying to self, which is supported by a fraternity of like-minded men for greater interior freedom and, eventually, a more purified and selfless love.</description>
